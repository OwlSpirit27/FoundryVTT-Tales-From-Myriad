## Known Bugs (and how to bypass them)
* Character sheets may need to be refreshed multiple times on initial creation, which should fix errors on labels across the sheet
* Players may need to click *Normal* on their Advantage section to fix core rolls on new character creation


### Sample Bestiary
Contains all of the entries from Myriad's Sample Bestiary, complete with their loot as items.
