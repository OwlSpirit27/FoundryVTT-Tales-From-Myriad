## Known Bugs (and how to bypass them)
* Character sheets may need to be refreshed multiple times on initial creation, which should fix errors on labels across the sheet
* Players may need to click *Normal* on their Advantage section to fix core rolls on new character creation
* On first import, you'll be spammed by warnings that item templates have been deleted. Don't worry! The sheets will function normally, and resetting Foundry seems to stop the errors. 

# Manual Installation
* Open FoundryVTT and head to Game Systems -> Install System and grab `Custom System Builder` by LinkedFluuuush
* (optional but very cool) head to Add-on Modules and grab `Dice So Nice` and `Lancer Initiative`
* Head to [Releases](https://github.com/OwlSpirit27/FoundryVTT-Tales-From-Myriad/releases) page and download the latest everything-myriad
* Unzip it into your `AppData/Local/FoundryVTT/Data/modules` folder
* Create a world using the Custom System Builder system
* In the world, head to Settings in the top right -> Manage Modules and turn on the downloaded module
* Reset the world and the content should appear in your Compendium, where you can import the adventure and go crazy
